# Financial_Interface

This is a project for my own development. 
I always wanted to learn C++ and I thought it would 
interesting to build some kind of financial dashboard
or interface, where I could integrate my knowledge of 
financial products. This will probably be an indefinite 
work-in-progress.

The customer table was created from the following simple script:

create table customers (
tax_id varchar(10),
last_name varchar(30), 
first_name varchar(30),
checking_balance float,
pin int
);
